  <h1>Hello MongoDB</h1>
    <p>
      For this assignment, you must create a web application that allows you to:
      <ul>
        <li>Create, Read, and Query documents within a MongoDB collection.</li>
        <li>These documents should represent some kind of object or record of your choosing (e.g. a scientific data set, an inventory, a user group, etc.)</li>
        <li>Each document must have at least 4 different fields, of at least 3 different types, e.g. string, number, and date. </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Note that these fields do not include the requisite id for each document.
      To create new documents, your node.js application should serve a simple html form at the path /upload that allows for the entry of a new document into the mongodb collection using an HTTP post request.
      Your node.js application should serve a page at the /list path that lists all objects within your collection. This page can be either rendered server side or client side using AJAX to a rest route.</p>
      
      <p>Your node.js application should finally serve a page at the /query path that takes some input into a form and makes a parameterized query of your data set. For example, given a number, display all inventoried items that cost less than that price sorted from least expensive to most. This request must be made via AJAX from the page at /query, i.e., using XMLHttpRequest or Fetch.</p>
      
      <p>Your application should support at least two rest routes: one POST route at /<object name> to create an object in your dataset, and one GET route at /<object name>s that takes query parameters to make to return query result of objects.</p>
    </p>
    
    <p>Make sure to include a readme with all of your route names and example queries.</p>

    <h1>Info Form</h1>
    <form action="/upload" method="post">
      <label for="name">Name:</label><br />
      <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required value="dukesook"><br /><br />
  
      <label for="date">Date:</label><br />
      <input type="date" id="date" name="date" required value="2025-03-25"><br /><br />
  
      <label for="city">City:</label><br />
      <input type="text" id="city" name="city" required value="Las Cruces"><br /><br />

      <label for="age">Age:</label><br />
      <input type="number" id="age" name="age" min="0" required value="29"><br /><br />
